          The philosophers of Ancient Greece tended to think of the world in
          terms of its most fundamental truths, which can be used to derive
          further truths. In contrast, the world today often attempts to find
          deeper truths by observing higher-level, more abstract concepts. For
          example, a Greek would think about how <i>x</i> affects <i>f(x)</i>,
          while a modern physicist might graph <i>f(x)</i> to find how it is
          affected by changes in <i>x</i>.

          The point is not to prove one approach or the other better: they
          both have their merits and are advantageous to use in different
          situations. If a physicist attempted to think about classical
          mechanics in terms of the individual subatomic particles and their
          interactions, they would never get anywhere. We need to generate
          <i>abstractions</i> to help us think at larger scales. Likewise, some problems
          require a more theoretical approach to get exact results. Calculus
          in particular lends itself well to this approach, as it allows the
          user to deal with infinitesimally small changes.

          In conclusion, <b>physics is the fine art of approximation</b>. As physicists,
          we try to find exact solutions when possible but also appreciate the value of
          "good enough." Oftentimes, an approximation will be used instead of the
          more precise relationship because the values are not significantly
          different under the given conditions. Maintaining strict exactitude
          would simply increase the difficulty of the problem unnecessarily,
          and even make it more likely for the calculation to go wrong.
