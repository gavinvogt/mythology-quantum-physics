      <p>
          Quantum physics is a mind-boggling field that seems to defy reality.
          In fact, it defines reality. The physics of everyday life is known
          as <i>classical</i> physics and only applies to objects that are large
          (compared to an atom).
      </p>
      <p>
          When quantum mechanics is applied to a large object, its conclusions
          match with the classical understanding. However, classical mechanics
          tends to break down as objects become very small. This demonstrates
          that quantum physics is the more complete description of reality
          since it extends to a wider array of objects.
      </p>

          Two of the most fundamental tenets of quantum physics are quantization and superposition.
          <br>
          <i>Quantization:</i> Quantities are limited to discrete (non-continuous) values.
          <br>
          <i>Superposition:</i> A particle's state is an additive combination
          of every possible state that may be observed if it were measured. It
          is not in a well-defined state until measured!

              How have Aristotle and his contemporaries shaped our modern
              understanding of quantum physics?

          <li>
              How can the connection between Greek philosophy and quantum
              physics guide our ways of thinking?
